Student-Information-Record-System
The Student Information Record System is a project designed to enhance the efficiency and user experience of student registration processes within educational institutions. Beginning with a secure user authentication process, the system requires users to input their email id, password, and successfully complete a Captcha challenge. The login interface includes a reset button for swift information clearing, ensuring a seamless experience. Once logged in, users proceed to a comprehensive registration form where mandatory fields such as registration number, student name, email, batch, department, phone number, address, and parent name are filled out. This form also includes the option to upload a photo. Both a reset and submit button are provided on the registration form, allowing users to reset information o initiate the registration process, respectively. Upon successful submission, a confirmation message pops up, reassuring users that their registration is complete. All entered informqation is securely stored in the database, associated with the user’s unique email id, ensuring data integrity.
